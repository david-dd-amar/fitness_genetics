These are the analysis scripts, ordered according to the analysis steps:
1. parse_vcfs_and_liftover.sh - liftover elite's raw data and filter the vcf using GATK's best practices 
	generates: elite_n267_joint_hg38.filtered.biallelic.anno.vcf.gz
2. process_elite_vcf.sh - analyze the filtered vcf above using PLINK, filter variants by maf, hwe, and missingness
	generates plink output files in /oak/stanford/groups/euan/projects/elite/ukbb_exome/elite_analyze_vcf 
3. analyze_vs_ref_and_pop.sh - take the elite and ukbb pgens as input, a pop file (file with sample ids to include), a set of thresholds (e.g., for MAF)
	limits the data to the given pop
	compute variant statistics in each cohort separately (elite, ukbb)
	filter the data, run ld prune, pca, relatedness
	output is kept in the eu_beds dir

# helper scripts:
* extract_freq_vars.R - helper function that intersects two PLINK's freq files with an input threshold for each file
			prints the output the the stdout
* intersect_bims.R - takes two bim files and: 
			(1) generates chr:pos:ref:alt ids for each file and print a new bim for each file, 
			(2) take the variant intersection, and 
			(3) print a file with the intersection, can be use with --extract in plink.
