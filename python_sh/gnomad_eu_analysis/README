Make sure that the input vcfs (e.g., elite) has the "chrXX" chromosome format (see export options in plink)
These are later removed when the data are compared to the afreq files

Here we use our bcftools to intersect our vcfs with gnomad and then take the EU AFs from the gnomad files for the remaining variants.
See the create_files.sh script
It also uses the extract_eu_info.R script to get the relavant columns from the output vcf files from the bcftools isec commands.

compare_freq_with_gnomad.R - given the gnomad eu summary tables from the scripts above, this R script can be used to compare a "afreq" file from 
plink to the gnomad eu table. It computes P-values and also output the AFs. DO NOT confuse this script with the helper script compare_maf_to_gnomad.R
whose goal is to simply compare the AFs of an "afreq" file and a gnomad table and extracts a set of variant ids whose AFs do not agree with gnomAD.
